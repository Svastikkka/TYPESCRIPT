# Type Inference
- The interface contains only the declaration of the methods and fields, but not the implementation.
- The TypeScript compiler uses interface for type-checking (also known as "duck typing" or "structural subtyping") whether the object has a specific structure or not.
- Type inference describes where and how TypeScript infers types when you donâ€™t explicitly annotate them.
- In TypeScript, TypeScript compiler infers the type information when:
  - Variables and members are initialized
  - Setting default values for parameters
  - Determined function return types

## Basic type inference
- When you declare a variable, you can use a type annotation to explicitly specify a type for it. 
- For example: `let counter: number;`
- However, if you initialize the counter variable to a number, TypeScript will infer the type the counter to be number. 
- For example: `let counter = 0;` is equivalent to the following statement: `let counter: number = 0;`
- Likewise, when you assign a function parameter a value, TypeScript infers the type of the parameter to the type of the default value. 
- For example:
  ```
  function setCounter(max=100) {
    // ...
    }
  ```
- In this example, TypeScript infers type of the max parameter to be number.
- Similarly, TypeScript infers the following return type of the `increment()` function as number:
  ```
  function increment(counter: number) {
    return counter++;
    }
  ```
- It is the same as:
  ```
  function increment(counter: number) : number {
    return counter++;
    }
  ```
## The best common type algorithm
- Consider the following assignment:
  ```
  let items = [1, 2, 3, null];
  ```
- To infer the type of `items` variable, TypeScript needs to consider the type of each element in the array.
- It uses the best common type algorithm to analyze each candidate type and select the type that is compatible with all other candidates.
- In this case, TypeScript selects the number array type (number[]) as the best common type.
- If you add a string to the `items` array, TypeScript will infer the type for the items as an array of numbers and strings: `(number | string)[]`
  ```let items = [0, 1, null, 'Hi'];```
- When TypeScript cannot find the best common type, it returns the union array type. 
- For example:
  ```let arr = [new Date(), new RegExp('\d+')];```
- In this example, TypeScript infers the type for arr to be `(RegExp | Date)[]`.
