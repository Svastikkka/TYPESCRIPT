# How Typescript solves the problems of dynamic types

To fix the previous problem of referencing a property that doesn’t exist on an object, you do the following steps:

First, define the “shape” of the product object using an `interface`.
```
interface Product{
    id: number,
    name: string,
    price: number
};
```
Second, explicitly use the Product type as the return type of the `getProduct()` function:

```
function getProduct(id) : Product{
  return {
    id: id,
    name: `Awesome Gadget ${id}`,
    price: 99.5
  }
}
```


When you reference a property that doesn’t exist, the code editor will inform you immediately:

```
const product = getProduct(1);
console.log(`The product ${product.Name} costs $${product.price}`);
```
The code editor highlighted the following error on the ***Name*** property:


And to solve the problem of passing the arguments in the wrong order, you explicitly assign types to function parameters:

```
const showProduct = (name: string, price:number)  => {
  console.log(`The product ${name} costs ${price}$.`);
};
```
And when you pass the arguments of the wrong types to the showProduct() function, you’ll receive an error:
```
const product = getProduct(1);
showProduct(product.price, product.name);
```

# Conclusion
- JavaScript is dynamically typed. It offers flexibility but also creates many problems
- TypeScript adds an optional type system to JavaScript to solve these problems.
