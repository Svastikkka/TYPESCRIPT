# TypeScript Setup
The following tools you need to setup to start with TypeScript:
  * ***Node.js*** – Node.js is the environment on which you will run the TypeScript compiler. Note that you don’t need to know node.js.
  * ***TypeScript compiler*** – a Node.js module that compiles TypeScript into JavaScript. If you use JavaScript for node.js, you can install the `ts-node` module. It is a TypeScript execution and REPL for node.js
  
  If you use VS Code, you can install the following extension to speed up the development process:
  * ***Live Server*** – allows you to launch a development local Server with the hot reload feature.
  
  ## Install Node.js
  To install node.js, you follow these steps:
  * Download the node.js version that suits your platform i.e., Windows, macOS, or Linux.
  * Execute the downloaded node.js package or execution file. The installation is quite straightforward.
  * Verify the installation by open the terminal on macOS and Linux or command line on Windows and type the command `node -v` . If you see the version that you downloaded, then you have successfully installed the node.js on your computer.
  
  ## Install TypeScript compiler
  
  To install the TypeScript compiler, you launch the Terminal on macOS or Linux and Command Prompt on Windows and type the following command:
  
  ```
  npm install -g typescript
  ```
  
  After the installation, you can type the following command to check the current version of the TypeScript compiler:
  
  ```
  tsc --v
  ```
  It should return the verison like this:
  
  ```
  Version 4.0.2
  ```
  
  To install the `ts-node` module globally, you run the following command from the Terminal on macOS and Linux or Command Prompt on Windows:
  
  ```
  npm install -g ts-node
  ```
