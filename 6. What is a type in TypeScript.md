# What is a type in TypeScript?
- In TypeScript, a type is a convenient way to refer to the different properties and functions that a value has.
- A value is anything that you can assign to a variable e.g., a number, a string, an array, an object, and a function.

## Example:-
```
'Hello'
```
- You can say that itâ€™s a string. And this value has properties and methods that a string has. 
- For example, the `'Hello'` value has a property called `length` that returns the number of characters.
```
 console.log('Hello'.length);
```
It also has many methods like `match()`, `indexOf()`, and `toLocaleUpperCase()`.
A shorter way to refer to a value is to assign it a type. In this example, you say the `'Hello'` is a string. Then, you know that you can use the properties and methods of a string for the value `'Hello'`.

## In conclusion, in TypeScript:
- A type is a label that describes the different properties and method that a value has
- Every value has a type.
