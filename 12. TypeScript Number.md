# TypeScript Number
- All numbers in TypeScript are either floating-point values or big integers.
- The floating-point numbers have the type `number` while the big integers get the type `bigint`.

## The number type
- The following shows how to declare a variable that holds a floating-point value:
  `let price: number;`
- Or you can initialize the price variable to a number:
  `let price = 9.95; \\type floating-point number`
  
***Note***:- As in JavaScript, TypeScript supports the number literals for decimal, hexadecimal, binary, and octal literals.

## Decimal numbers
- The following shows some decimal numbers:
  ```
  let counter: number = 0;
  let x: number = 100, 
      y: number = 200;
  ```
