# TypeScript Number
- All numbers in TypeScript are either floating-point values or big integers.
- The floating-point numbers have the type `number` while the big integers get the type `bigint`.

## The number type
- The following shows how to declare a variable that holds a floating-point value:
  `let price: number;`
- Or you can initialize the price variable to a number:
  `let price = 9.95; \\type floating-point number`
  
***Note***:- As in JavaScript, TypeScript supports the number literals for decimal, hexadecimal, binary, and octal literals.

## Decimal numbers
- The following shows some decimal numbers:
  ```
  let counter: number = 0;
  let x: number = 100, 
      y: number = 200;
  ```
## Binary Numbers
- The binary number uses a leading zero followed by a lowercase or uppercase letter “B” e.g., `0b` or `0B` :
  ```
  let bin = 0b100;
  let anotherBin: number = 0B010;
  ```
***Note*** :- The digit after 0b or 0B must be 0 or 1.

## Octal Numbers
- An octal number uses a leading zero followed the letter `o` (since ES2015) `0o`. The digits after `0o` are numbers in the range 0 through 7
  `let octal: number = 0o10;`

## Hexadecimal numbers
- Hexadecimal numbers use a leading zero followed by a lowercase or uppercase letter `X` (`0x` or `0X`).
- The digits after the 0x must be in the range (`0123456789ABCDEF`).
  `let hexadecimal: number = 0XA;`
## Big Integers
- The big integers represent the whole numbers larger than 253 – 1.
- A Big integer literal has the n character at the end of an integer literal like this:
  `let big: bigint = 9007199254740991n;`
  
***Note***:- Avoid using the Number type (floating point type) as much as possible.
