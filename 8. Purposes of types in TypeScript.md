# Purposes of types in TypeScript

There are two main purposes of types in TypeScript:

  - First, types are used by the TypeScript compiler to analyze your code for errors
  - Second, types allow you to understand what values are associated with variables.
  
## Examples of TypeScript types

The following example uses the `querySelector()` method to select the `<h1>` element:

```
const heading = document.querySelector('h1');
```

The TypeScript compiler knows that the type of ***heading*** is ***HTMLHeadingElement***.

[Image]

And it shows a list of methods of the ***HTMLHeadingElement*** type that ***heading*** can access:

[Image]

If you try to access a property or method that doesnâ€™t exist, the TypeScript compiler will show an error. For example:

[Image]

## Conclusion
- TypeScript compiler uses types to analyze your code for hunting bugs and errors.
- A type is a label that describes the properties and methods that a value has.
