# What is Type Annotation in TypeScript?
- TypeScript uses type annotations to explicitly specify types for identifiers such variables, functions, objects, etc.
- TypeScript uses the syntax : type after an identifier as the type annotation, where type can be any valid type.
- Once an identifier is annotated with a type, it can be used as that type only. If the identifier is used as a different type, the TypeScript compiler will issue an error.

## Type annotations in variables and constants
- The following syntax shows how to specify type annotations for variables and constants:
  ```
  let variableName: type;
  let variableName: type = value;
  const constantName: type = value;
  ```
***Note***:- In this syntax, the type annotation comes after the variable or constant name and is preceded by a colon (:).

## Example
- The following example uses `number` annotation for a variable:
  ```
  let counter: number;
  ```
- After this, you can only assign a number to the `counter `variable:
  ```
  counter = 1;
  ```
- If you assign a `string` to the counter variable, youâ€™ll get an error:
  ```
  let counter: number;
  counter = 'Hello'; // compile error 
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Type '"Hello"' is not assignable to type 'number'.
  ```
- You can both use a type annotation for a variable and initialize it in a single statement like this:
  ```
  let counter: number = 1;
  ```
