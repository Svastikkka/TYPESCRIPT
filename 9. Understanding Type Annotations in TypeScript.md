# What is Type Annotation in TypeScript?
- TypeScript uses type annotations to explicitly specify types for identifiers such variables, functions, objects, etc.
- TypeScript uses the syntax : type after an identifier as the type annotation, where type can be any valid type.
- Once an identifier is annotated with a type, it can be used as that type only. If the identifier is used as a different type, the TypeScript compiler will issue an error.

## Type annotations in variables and constants
- The following syntax shows how to specify type annotations for variables and constants:
  ```
  let variableName: type;
  let variableName: type = value;
  const constantName: type = value;
  ```
***Note***:- In this syntax, the type annotation comes after the variable or constant name and is preceded by a colon (:).
