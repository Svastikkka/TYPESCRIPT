# What is Type Annotation in TypeScript?
- TypeScript uses type annotations to explicitly specify types for identifiers such variables, functions, objects, etc.
- TypeScript uses the syntax : type after an identifier as the type annotation, where type can be any valid type.
- Once an identifier is annotated with a type, it can be used as that type only. If the identifier is used as a different type, the TypeScript compiler will issue an error.

## Type annotations in variables and constants
- The following syntax shows how to specify type annotations for variables and constants:
  ```
  let variableName: type;
  let variableName: type = value;
  const constantName: type = value;
  ```
***Note***:- In this syntax, the type annotation comes after the variable or constant name and is preceded by a colon (:).

## Example 1 
- The following example uses `number` annotation for a variable:
  ```
  let counter: number;
  ```
- After this, you can only assign a number to the `counter `variable:
  ```
  counter = 1;
  ```
- If you assign a `string` to the counter variable, you’ll get an error:
  ```
  let counter: number;
  counter = 'Hello'; // compile error 
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Type '"Hello"' is not assignable to type 'number'.
  ```
- You can both use a type annotation for a variable and initialize it in a single statement like this:
  ```
  let counter: number = 1;
  ```
## Example 2
- In this example, we use the number annotation for the counter variable and initialize it to one.
  ```
  let name: string = 'John';
  let age: number = 25;
  let active: boolean = true;
  ```
- In this example, the `name` variable gets the `string` type, the `age` variable gets the `number` type, and the `active` variable gets the `boolean` type.

## Example 3
- To annotate an array type you use use a specific type followed by a square bracket  `type[]` :
  ```
  let arrayName: type[];
  ```
- The following declares an array of strings:
  ```
  let names: string[] = ['John', 'Jane', 'Peter', 'David', 'Mary'];
  ```
## Example 4
- To specify a type for an object, you use the object type annotation. For example:
  ```
    let person: {
       name: string;
       age: number
    };

    person = {
       name: 'John',
       age: 25
    }; // valid
  ```
  In this example, the `person` object only accepts an object that has two properties: `name` with the `string` type and `age` with the `number` type.
## Example 5
- The following shows a function annotation with parameter type annotation and return type annotation:
  ```
  let greeting : (name: string) => string;
  ```
- In this example, you can assign any function that accepts a string and returns a string to the greeting variable:
  ```
  greeting = function (name: string) {
    return `Hi ${name}`;
  };
  ```
- The following causes an error because the function that is assigned to the greeting variable doesn’t match with its function type.
  ```
  greeting = function () {
    console.log('Hello');
  };
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Type '() => void' is not assignable to type '(name: string) => string'. Type 'void' is not assignable to type 'string'.
  ```
